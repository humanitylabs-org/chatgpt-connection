# ChatGPT (Wizard AI connection app)

The ChatGPT app is where the owner connects his ChatGPT subscriptions (Plus or Pro) for the server
(decision #61: one connection app per AI provider). Any number of subscriptions; the agent uses them all.

## What the agent must know

- Sign-in is done **by the owner, on the ChatGPT app's page**: **Sign in** (or **+ Add**), copy the code,
  **Open sign-in and paste the code**, approve on ChatGPT. ChatGPT refuses the code until the owner turns on
  **Settings → Security → Device code sign-in for Codex** once; the page says so first. Never ask the owner for
  a code, token or password in chat, and never try to sign in yourself.
- Each sign-in runs inside the agent (stock `hermes auth add openai-codex`, started by the agent's dashboard),
  so it lands in the agent's own credential pool and the agent renews it. Never read, copy, print or send
  Hermes' `auth.json` or any ChatGPT token: refresh tokens are single-use, so a copy signs the agent out.
- Status (read-only, never a token): the MCP tool `connection_status`, or `GET /api/connection` from the app
  network: `wizard.ai-connection/2` with `status`, `plan`, `usage`, `accounts` (one row per subscription) and
  `error` with a plain message.

## When status is `error`

- `error.code` `unreachable`, `not_configured` or `login_rejected`: the app can't reach or log in to the agent's
  dashboard (for example after the server's private address changed). Alongside your own Hermes: run
  `wam alongside`, then any `wam app update ...` it prints (re-points the app at this agent and restarts it);
  otherwise `wam app update wizard-chatgpt`. Then check again. The page shows the same reason with a Retry button.
- `limit`: that subscription hit its limit; the owner can add another one with **+ Add**.

## Limits

- One agent per app: the sign-ins belong to the agent this app is linked to.
- Personal use with the owner's own subscriptions.
